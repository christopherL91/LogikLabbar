\begin{abstract}

This paper describes a simple model verification system written in the programming language Prolog.
The system can verify models for a variety of rules given that the input is written using CTL.

\section{Background}

\newpage

\section{Example model}
We construct a model $\mathcal{M}$ for a web client that is accessing a server which requires authentication and authorization
before some of the resources hosted by the server may be accessed.

\subsection{Valid assumption}
Given the state \textit{logged in} assume that $EF(\neg logged \: in)$ holds.

This formula describes the condition that given a logged in state, there is a path
to reach a state where one is not logged in.

By analyzing the graph in figure \ref{fig:graph} we can see that one possible state that is reachable from
\textit{logged in} is the state \textit{start} where one is not logged in. Therefore we can conclude that this is intuitively correct.

\subsection{Invalid assumption}
Given the state \textit{login response} assume that $AX(logged \: in)$ holds.

This formula describes the condition that given a login response state, the next state must contain the propositional variable \textit{logged in}, i.e $L(s)=logged \: in$.

By analyzing the graph in figure \ref{fig:graph} and looking at the paths from \textit{login response} there is one path that describes a failed login where one is sent back to the \textit{start} state. Given this we deduce that the assumption does not hold as $logged \: in \notin L(start)$.

\section{Implementation}

\section{Results}
All the given tests are passing.

\section{Questions}

\Que{What's the difference between your implementation and the implementation written in the text book?}
%TODO
\Ans{
  contradictions
  until
  implications
}

\Que{How did you handle a variable number of premises in rules?}
\Ans{We use the built in predicate \textit{member} to iterate over all the neighbors.}

\Que{How big models can you handle with your implementation?}
\Ans{The time complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^p)$ increases by a factor for each time a rule that is using all neighbors to a state. That means that $p$ is increased by one for each time and we quickly approach a cubic asymptotic progression of the time $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$. This leads to an untenable situation for solving formulas in a reasonable amount of time for bigger models. For example, a model that has $10^3$ neighbors for each state, progressing only three states from the starting state will result in over $10^9$ checks being performed.}
